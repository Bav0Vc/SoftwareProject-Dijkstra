| :------------ | :----------- | :--------------- |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which of the following statements about Dijkstras algorithm is always true? |
| theoretical | Fillin          | Fill in the correct answer! Dijkstras algorithm selects the next vertex to process based on the vertex with the    known distance from the source that has not yet been visited.|
| theoretical | Drag and Drop   | Arrange the main steps of dijkstras algorithm in the correct order:                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Suppose you modify Dijkstra’s algorithm so that, instead of always picking the node with the smallest tentative distance, you pick a random node from the queue. What is the worst-case time complexity for finding the shortest path from a source to all nodes in a connected graph with nonnegative weights?  |
| theoretical | Fillin          | When Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented with a binary heap (priority queue), each decrease-key operation takes O(  ) time. Fill in the blank with the correct asymptotic complexity in terms of n.                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Why does Dijkstra's algorithm fail to find correct shortest paths if the graph contains a single negative-weight edge, even if there are no negative cycles?                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which statements correctly describe the behavior of Dijkstra’s algorithm?                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which of the following operations are performed inside Dijkstra’s main loop?                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which statements about the limitations and extensions of Dijkstra’s algorithm are true?                 |
| practical   | Multiple Choice | Find the shortest Path from A to B!|
| practical   | Multiple Choice | Find the shortest Path from A to E!                 |
| theoretical | Drag and Drop | What works with Dijkstra's algorithm?                 |
| theoretical | Drag and Drop | Sort the actions. What is allowed in Dijkstra's Algorithm and what is forbidden/impossible?                  |
| theoretical | Drag and Drop | Sort the features. Which traits belong to the real Dijkstra Algorithm, and which belong to other algorithms (like A*, DFS, or Bellman-Ford)?                 |
| theoretical | Drag and Drop | Imagine Dijkstra's algorithm is a machine. Sort the items: Are they raw materials you put IN, or results that come OUT?                 |
| theoretical | Drag and Drop | While Dijkstra's algorithm is running: Which data changes constantly, and which data stays fixed (never changes)?                 |
| dynamic     | Fillin        | Find the shortest path from x to x.                 |
| dynamic     | Fillin        | Determine the shortest path from [var=source_question_7] to [var=target_question_7].
