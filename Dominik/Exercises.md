| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Suppose you modify Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm so that, instead of always picking the node with the smallest tentative distance, you pick a random node from the queue. What is the worst-case time complexity for finding the shortest path from a source to all nodes in a connected graph with nonnegative weights? |
