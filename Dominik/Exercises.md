| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which of the following statements about Dijkstras algorithm is always true? |
| theoretical | Fillin          | Fill in the correct answer! Dijkstras algorithm selects the next vertex to process based on the vertex with the    known distance from the source that has not yet been visited.|
| theoretical | Grag and Drop   | Arrange the main steps of dijkstras algorithm in the correct order:                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Suppose you modify Dijkstra’s algorithm so that, instead of always picking the node with the smallest tentative distance, you pick a random node from the queue. What is the worst-case time complexity for finding the shortest path from a source to all nodes in a connected graph with nonnegative weights?  |
| theoretical | Fillin          | When Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented with a binary heap (priority queue), each decrease-key operation takes O(  ) time. Fill in the blank with the correct asymptotic complexity in terms of n.                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Why does Dijkstra's algorithm fail to find correct shortest paths if the graph contains a single negative-weight edge, even if there are no negative cycles?                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which statements correctly describe the behavior of Dijkstra’s algorithm?                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which of the following operations are performed inside Dijkstra’s main loop?                 |
| theoretical | Multiple Choice | Which statements about the limitations and extensions of Dijkstra’s algorithm are true?                 |
